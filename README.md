### Task 1: Build a Multiple Linear Regression model that predicts the number of deaths in various
countries due to COVID-19. You are free to select and choose the dataset you would like to
use while building the model and are allowed to use the Pandas Library in your code and can
use Excel.

- Find data sets for the number of deaths in various countries (a minimum of 20 countries)
due to COVID-19.
- Research for appropriate predictor variables to predict deaths due to COVID-19.
- You may use time as one of the predictors (in which case you could attempt to predict
death rates in the future), or you may choose to leave it out (in which case, you would
be looking at the deaths at a fixed chosen point in time).
- Find data sets on the chosen predictors for the various countries in the model.
- Use plots to visualize and understand your data.
- Build a model and test the accuracy of your model, using an appropriately chosen metric
(hint: r2 is not a good metric for this task).
- If needed, improve your model by incorporating other predictors, and/or removing
existing ones.
- Discuss your data sets, model, accuracy, and what metrics you used to judge the
accuracy
